**Sometimes the best way to save the world is to ignore it completely.**

Nathan Lee has exactly three talents: overthinking social encounters, avoiding responsibility, and farming in video games. When the apocalypse hits, he accidentally dumps all his rare skill points into... fishing. Just his luck.

Now Nathan's trapped in the hardest tutorial mode the System could devise. After that, nine deadly realms stand between humanity and their way home.

The would-be heroes can go save the world with [Gigantic Sword of Doom] and [Fireball Barrage]. Nathan's busy maxing out [Ability to Sit Quietly in a Boat]. Heâ€™ll ride out the end times and leave the hero stuff to people who don't get queasy at the sight of blood.

Too bad the universe has other plans.

His first day in the tutorial, he accidentally deletes a monster from reality thanks to a system bug. Then he feeds experimental radishes to a giant snail and somehow earns [Shell of Protection]. Now he's taking down ogres with his fishing rod turned oversized mace!? It turns out that side quest rewards and weak classes are more powerful than anyone expected...

**So grab your tackle box and buckle your overalls. It's sink or swim in this side-questing calamity!**
