**Demons fear swords and magic. They never saw the needle coming.**

The Demon King has raged across Cortia for 50 years. He’s opposed by Otherworlders: powerful soldiers who posess the unique ability to bond with Spirit Weapons.

When runaway teen Ezra wakes up in another world, the kingdom makes him an offer: fight for them, and he’ll be granted a spirit weapon. Ezra accepts, expecting a sword or a spear.

He certainly doesn’t expect a sentient needle with a petty streak and a hidden past.

With monsters, murderous Knight Commanders, and his own weapon breathing down his throat, a normal person would probably buckle under the pressure. For Ezra, this is an opportunity—thanks to levels, the power he’s craved is finally in sight.

And nothing’s going to get in his way.
