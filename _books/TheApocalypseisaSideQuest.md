**Sometimes the best way to save the world is to ignore it completely.**

Nathan Lee has exactly three talents: overthinking social encounters, avoiding responsibility, and farming in video games. When the apocalypse hits, he accidentally dumps all his rare skill points into… fishing. Just his luck.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the kind of apocalypse he can dodge by hiding in his room. Humanity has been ripped from Earth and dropped into a colossal multidimensional dungeon—a nine-realm gauntlet straight out of a nightmare. Legends armed with [Gigantic Sword of Doom] and [Fireball Barrage] are fighting to carve a path home. Nathan? He’s busy maxing out [Ability to Sit Quietly in a Boat]. He’ll leave the hero stuff to someone who doesn’t get queasy at the sight of blood.

Too bad the universe has other plans.

On his first day in the tutorial, he accidentally deletes a monster from reality thanks to a system bug. Then he feeds a snail radishes and gets a rare skill. Now he's taking down ogres with his fishing rod!? It turns out that side quest rewards and weak classes are more powerful than anyone expected...

**So grab your tackle box and buckle your overalls. It's sink or swim in this side-questing calamity!**
