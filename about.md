!["OwO Hello there!"](assets/portrait.jpeg#right){: .align-right}{: width="45%" } Hello there! My name is Liam Lawless. I'm a writer and student from deep in the heart of Texas (though I had a brief stint in the Philippines). At the current moment, I'm going to Houston Community College and heading to Texas A&M next semester.

What's my degree? Economics! Because that makes perfect sense with my personality, obviously.

I've always wanted to be a writer since as long as I can remember. Stories of heroes and villains, knights and princesses---they lit something inside of me and made me want to share stories of my own with the world. 

Unfortunately, writing a book is easier said than done! Turns out that most 14 year olds aren't well-equipped with the life experience and discipline needed to write something halfway decent.

While I wouldn't say that I've matured significantly, I have come a long way since then. I think that I am now at least *more* ready to tell my tales then I was in the past.

This is usually the part where I'd tell you that I'm strongly influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien and George R.R. Martin. And while I suppose that isn't entirely false, it isn't entirely true either. I am far more influenced by the simple power fantasy isekai fanfictions and animes that characterized my teenage years.

Yes, even SAO.

Anyway, I'm glad to see you here, friend! I hope you get some enjoyment from reading my thoughts and ramblings---and I even more hope that you take a look at my books (if you're unsure about whether or not to buy, I always have a sample available for reading here on the website). If you want to talk to me, feel free to shoot me an email or drop a comment.
